                            <strong>Hi! I'm Oderemi Emmanuel.</strong> I am a software developer. I feel so proud to
                            introduce myself with that line because
                            i have always wanted to be a developer, and it took me too long to acheive this, but we
                            thank
                            the Lord.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alright,</strong> I am a native of Ogun State, but i was born and brought up in
                            Lagos,
                            so definitely i have never been
                            to my ancentral home before, but i hear Abeokuta people are warriors, which explains how
                            fantabulous i am in
                            Call of Duty games. I am first of 3 4 children. I am a graduate of Lagos state university,
                            ojo.
                            I have a BSc in
                            Computer Science. I know what you are thinking.. Yes! You are right, we were taught next to
                            nothing, the 4 years
                            was majorly a waste of my life span because everything i learnt was on my own. I never had a
                            mentor, so i spent
                            too many years learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>I have always been a master of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, but i wanted more.</strong> I
                            finally discovered Udemy in 2019, and i have
                            taken up to 5 courses there. I started as a full stack developer with node. I actually have
                            created a Database application
                            using Nodejs. Early this year i completed my React course. I can proudly say i LOVE REACT! I
                            have an application which is
                            nearing completion though. I decided to take the Stutern course because i haven't worked
                            much in
                            a team, and i want to
                            feel that and learn from people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Back to my life!</strong> I am not a shy person, but i hate being in the spot light,
                            i
                            prefer to be in the background. I love anime,
                            I love gaming, I love music, I love movies. BEST OF ALL, I love to write code!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <Strong>Well</Strong>, this is Emmanuel! I hope i didn't bore you to death. This is just my
                            Ninja Way!
