                        <strong>Hi! I'm Oderemi Emmanuel.</strong> I am a software developer. I feel so proud to introduce myself with that line because
                        i have always wanted to be a developer, and it took me too long to acheive this, but we thank the Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Alright,</strong> I am a native of Ogun State, but i was born and brought up in Lagos, so definitely i have never been
                        to my ancentral home before, but i hear Abeokuta people are warriors, which explains how fantabulous i am in 
                        Call of Duty games. I am first of 3 4 children. I am a graduate of Lagos state university, ojo. I have a BSc in
                        Computer Science. I know what you are thinking.. Yes! You are right, we were taught next to nothing, the 4 years
                        was majorly a waste of my life span because everything i learnt was on my own. I never had a mentor, so i spent
                        too many years learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>I have always been a master of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, but i wanted more.</strong> I finally discovered Udemy in 2019, and i have
                        taken up to 5 courses there. I started as a full stack developer with node. I actually have created a Database application
                        using Nodejs. Early this year i completed my React course. I can proudly say i LOVE REACT! I have an application which is
                        nearing completion though. I decided to take the Stutern course because i haven't worked much in a team, and i want to
                        feel that and learn from people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Back to my life!</strong> I am not a shy person, but i hate being in the spot light, i prefer to be in the background. I love anime,
                        I love gaming, I love music, I love movies. BEST OF ALL, I love to write code!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <Strong>Well</Strong>, this is Emmanuel! I hope i didn't bore you to death. This is just my Ninja Way!
